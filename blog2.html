        <p class="blogcontent">Wednesday, November 6th.<br>
            The city is under the water. The national guard is coming.
            Martial law is in effect, but the criminal element never sleeps. 
            Looting and lawlessness will be rampant... in the parts of the city, no one can get to. 
            I can already see things will get worse... before they get better. 
            And some will seize the chance to grab everything they can.
            I’m starting to see now. I have had an effect here. 
            But not the one I intended. Vengeance, won’t change the past. 
            Mine… or anyone else’s. I have to become more. People need hope. 
            To know someone’s out there for them. This cities angry, and scarred. 
            Like me. Our scars can destroy us… even after the physical wounds have healed. 
            But if we can survive them. They can give us the power. To Endure. And the strength to fight.</p>
