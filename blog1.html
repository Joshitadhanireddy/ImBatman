            This is an introduction to some of the dogs on our campus and where to find them.
            As you walk from Kadamb to Bakul after Biryani Wednesday, Chintu will come to you with a wagging tail and will not stop crying until you give him the pets he deserves
            When you enter your first class of the day, completely sleep deprived and lowkey dying, Gopi shows up just to sleep & not die (productive queen)
            When you go to acad office to get your attendance issue fixed, Lily, the absolute cutie, follows you around(actually a problem, bro doesn't stop). 
            Alex, our attention seeker, usually has a crowd of fans around her as she sits and does nothing and looks cute.
            Greyhound,always a mystery (may be the real batman), is right outside SBI to obviously annihilate robbers. 
            Goodboi, stationed at the main gate, right under the biometric machine(like right under, right under), reminds us of the importance of sleep and not giving a fudge.
